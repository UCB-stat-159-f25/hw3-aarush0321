# Homework 3

In this homework assignment, we went back to the LIGO wave detection tutorial notebook from homework 2. We created a utils.py module in the ligotools package, where we put in some popular functions from the tutorial notebook. We also made the ligotools package installable, and set up testing for some of the functions in ligotools using pytest. At the end, we set up a MyST website and deployed it on GitHub using GitHub Actions. It will automatically update every time we push to the repo.
